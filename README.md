# P2P File Sharing System

A peer-to-peer (P2P) file sharing system built to enable decentralized file exchange between users without relying on a central server. This project demonstrates core networking concepts, peer discovery, and file transfer protocols.

## Overview

This system allows peers to:

- Discover other peers on the network
- Share and request files directly
- Transfer files using TCP sockets
- Maintain a local index of available files

## Technologies Used

- **Language**: Java
- **Networking**: TCP sockets
- **Architecture**: Decentralized P2P
- **Optional**: Multithreading, file hashing
